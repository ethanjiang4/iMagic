# Welcome to iMagic!

This is a small personal project that I try and work on from time to time. I use it to perform magic tricks at my gigs - note that this README won't contain any guides on how to do the tricks. This app is meant for magicians with experience to incorporate into an already existing routine.

## About

iMagic comes with 4 tricks loaded and an AR feature that's currently being worked on. Some of the tricks include guessing a spectator's card from seemingly random questions and another include text messaging the spectator's phone with their card. It's currently optimized for my iPhone X so you may have to make some changes to get it working on your phone.
